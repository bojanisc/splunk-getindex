Splunk-getindex
Author: Bojan Zdrnja, <bojan.zdrnja@infigo.hr>

Want to see full status of your indexes, including retention periods?
Splunk-getindex is the right command for you!

This is a simple command that will allow you to query status of indexes
directly from Splunk.

In order to use the command simply search for "| getindex".
The command will return status of all indexes, including the following
information:

- Index name
- Retention time in days
- Current size in MB
- Is the index internal or not?
- Local path of the index
- Archive directory (if set)
- First and last event time

The command needs the Splunk Python SDK. Install it into the following
directory:
   $SPLUNK_HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages/splunklib

Splunk Python SDK is available from:
http://dev.splunk.com/goto/sdk-python

A simple dashboard with a table showing the indexes is available too.

Enjoy!
